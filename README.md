# GaLi
 A (very unfinished) 2D graphics/game library based on OpenGL, using OpenTK. It's very barebones for now, but features simple geometric shapes and even physics powered by FarseerPhysics.
 
In order to get an understanding of how to use it, you should check out the *ImplementedPhysicsTest* function within GaLi.Test.SimpleTests.
More documentation will follow, since this is one of my more non-self-explanatory projects.
